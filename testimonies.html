                        name is Sami Iâ€™ve been fasting and joining
                        your prophetic prayers. I just wanted to testify of what the Lord has done so far in this new
                        year for me. One of the things I asked the Lord this year is that He would move miraculously in
                        the area of my finances and allow me and my husband to become debt free. I prophesied that this
                        year would be the year we would be debt free. We just received good news yesterday that our rent
                        has been covered for us for the next 2 months.. TWO WHOLE MONTHS!!! I know that could only be
                        the hand of God. This will allow us to begin aggressively going after our credit card debt and
                        other debt we accumulated last year. All glory to God!</p>

                    <p class="all_prayer_requests_text___3"><strong>TESTIMONY OF DELIVERANCE</strong><br>Good afternoon. I was watching your 25 January live session at 16:20 and
                        when you spoke about stagnancy I started shaking and felt something leave me. I am based in
                        South Africa and was especially touched by today's session because stagnancy has been a big
                        stumbling block in my life. One night when I was sleeping I felt something sit on my bed and tie
                        my feet together with a rope. I believe that was the start of my issues with stagnancy. I
                        believe God was speaking to me today also because when I left work today I had the urge to read
                        the story of Daniel as I was waiting for the bus and you spoke abt everything the spirit
                        ministered.Glory to God, may he continue to use you mightily.</p><br>

                        brought back a memory, from several years back: My mother told me a friend told her what my
                        first car should be. Interestingly, my family handed me down two cars after that, but both had
                        totaling accidents. Restoration is real, GOD never forgets. I experienced about two weeks of
                        confirmation. December 22,2021, the Lord told me to go to a car dealer, because I was going
                        to get a car, so I prayed, went to bed, and the next day, December 23, HE woke me up out of my
                        sleep to get ready and go to the dealer, buy a car. I turn on your prophetic prayers as I get
                        ready and Chantal says, someone else is getting a car. I purchased my first car that day, just
                        as GOD said. Obedience.</p>

                                        <p class="all_prayer_requests_text___3"><strong>TESTIMONY OF NEW CAR</strong><br>Hallelujah, praise God!! The Lord blessed me with a car the same day you said God is giving someone a car. I received that prophecy and acted on it as I needed a car to go back to work. The Lord blessed me with a car that I had desired for a few years but wasn't able to buy until now. I received it last Saturday. Other people were interested in the car but the dealership reserved it for me without needing to pay a deposit. Thank you Lord for favour. Thank you sis Chantal for being a blessing. God bless you </p>

                                        <p class="all_prayer_requests_text___3"><strong>TESTIMONY OF NEW JOB</strong><br>Praise the Lord, Woman of God. You prayed a prayer about rejections and God turning it around. I had a job rejection. I sat for an interview that seemed promising but was rejected. I applied for another job and was accepted. I just interviewed last week. God is good regardless. I said
boldly "What God has for me is for me" I knew that God would open doors specifically for me.

I praise God for you yeilding to the Holy Spirit. I have been blessed by your prayers and after being introduced to your channel I have been proclaiming and declaring the word of the Lord over my life. God bless you!!</p><br>
                                    <p class="all_prayer_requests_text___3"><strong>TESTIMONY OF SURPRISE</strong><br>Good morning Sis Chantal,
On Monday you talked/ pray about receiving surprises from God this week. When I got to work Monday I got an email from HR concerning my back pay from since October of 2021. They are finally going to back pay me. I was in disbelief. My manager, supervisor and myself have sent several emails and I honestly almost give up! But I am very grateful to God!
Also, my husband had this interview today for a new position at work that he applied for since January! God has just been so so good to my family! March is indeed a month of open doors and surprises!
May God keep blessing you woman of God!</p><br>

Needed to lift Â£10 for petrol for car so went to the ATM and discovered i had Â£446 pounds in my account.

I still have to find out if it was from a freind in Switzerland. Bless you my sister.all the Glory goes to God.

I just started watching you about a month ago. This week you prophesied that God will surprise us.I believe in God's word even though i didn't know how it would happen. Today morning I received a text from my previous manager at a job that I left a year ago asking me to go to the office,that they found my Christmas bonus from 2years ago while cleaning a drawer. Cash!I've only left the job a year. How is that possible?God you're faithful!</p>

                                        <p class="all_prayer_requests_text___3"><strong>TESTIMONY OF HEALING</strong><br>Good morning Sis. Chantal. I give God praise for your faithfulness. I want to give God thanks for His mercy and grace. Iâ€™ve had a pain in my right side since December 2019. As we prayed a week and a half ago and you prophesied on healing, I tapped in and believed. God healed me supernaturally, doing what the doctors couldnâ€™t do. The pain is completely gone, I havenâ€™t felt it since, even after things that use to trigger it. To God be the glory. Thank you Abba Father.</p>

You mentioned my case and I believed that I was healed. I woke up today completely healed. That headache is gone! Thank you so much for your prayers prophetess. May God continue to strengthen you and bless you. Grateful to God for using you so mightily.</p>
